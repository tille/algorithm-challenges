# algorithm-challenges
Solutions to some data structures and algorithm challenges written by me among [2009 - 2016].

It was such a trip tru the hardest known-problems in computer science, great minds, great algorithms, amazing places
and extraordinary people.

The competitive programming journey will always be in my memories,
I would leave this repo active as reference for new contesters and will be eventualy updated.
